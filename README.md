<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

IÂ´m a civil engineer switching to Data Science and IÂ´ve been studying Machine Learning since 2019. I am focused in achieving mastery in the development of solutions to business problems, using Data Science tools and going from the stage of understanding the business context to deploying Machine Learning models and creating new business insights.

During this time, I have developed solutions for business problems such as identifying customers in churn, prioritizing customers for cross-selling, reducing CAC values, predicting a store sales and creating an EDA from data scraped from an advertisement website.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.


### **Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** web scraping, SQL, MySQL.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** Python, Spark.

**Development:** Git. 

**Data Vizualization:** Power BI.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series. 

**Machine Learning Deployment:** Flask, Heroku.  


## Data Science Projects:

### [Sales Prediction](https://github.com/LucasEzBM/rossmann-sales)

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.


### [UserÂ´s First Booking](https://github.com/LucasEzBM/airbnb_users_first_booking) 

In this multilabel imbalanced classification problem, Airbnb needs to predict the which country a new user's first booking destination will be. There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'. At each crisp cycle the model gets less biased towards the 'USA' outcome, and increases its balanced accuracy.

### [Churn Prediciton](https://github.com/LucasEzBM/churn_prediction) 

In saturated markets, the cost to retain a customer is much less than prospecting for new customers. Machine Learning models are able to predict whether or not the customer will renew their service contract with the company in the next year. This information about the users is very important to optimize efforts in prioritizing customers who should continue with the contract in the company. In this context, I developed a Machine Learning algorithm to identify whether or not a customer will stop using the banking service.

### [Web Scraping for EDA from rent prices at OLX](https://github.com/LucasEzBM/scraper_rent_prices)

Often, when looking to rent a place, advertising websites can be quite dispendious to scroll around. Looking to have a view of the big picture of prices for houses and apartments in a city, I developed this scraper that goes through OLXÂ´s data, cleans it up and provides a basic EDA of house prices.
